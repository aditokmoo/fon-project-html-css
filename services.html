                        <p>
                            Keeping your air conditioning working properly and running for a
                            long time to come is something that we take very seriously. We
                            don’t want you to be without your A/C because that means that
                            the comfort in your home is nonexistent. When the summer months
                            start to roll around and you haven’t touched your A/C in a few
                            months after the cold season, you may want to consider having a
                            tune-up. This will allow your system to get checked out, filters
                            changed, and make sure everything is cleared out and running
                            smoothly. All of your HVAC maintenance can be set up ahead of
                            time if you want to get a maintenance package. That way you
                            don’t have to worry about the cost when the time comes around
                            because you will have already paid for it. We can send you
                            reminders if you’d like as well.

                        <h2>Our A/C Services</h2>
                        <p>
                            When there is a repair that needs to be done, we will show you
                            everything that we found and explain to you why you need the
                            repair and be able to provide you with options. We will always
                            try to make the repair before just installing a new A/C because
                            we know that that can be a big blow to the budget, especially
                            when it is not expected. Repairs are typically simple and fast.
                            We will almost always be able to do it the same day as long as
                            we have the parts with us. This is one reason we have a fully
                            stocked truck that we take with us so that we don’t have to wait
                            to order a part and then come back and inconvenience you on
                            another day. There will be times though, that you may have to
                            have a new air conditioner installed. When your system starts
                            having multiple repairs a year or is getting up there in age, it
                            is more likely that you will need to get a new one. If you want
                            to avoid having to get a new A/C for as long as possible, it is
                            important that you change your filters and have it maintained
                            when it is supposed to. For all of your air conditioning needs,
                            call West-O-Plex A/C & Heating at 817-244-2511 and we will do
                            whatever we can to help you.
